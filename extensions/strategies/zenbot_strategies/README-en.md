# zenbot_strategies

These are my custom Zenbot strategies. I noticed some flaws in much of the strategies in Zenbot.
- Many of them could be combined to give better indication of when to trade.
- There wasn't really a strategy/trend based safety on trades.
- They could also be combined in order to give a little safety in the trades.

With this in mind, my focus has been to make a strategy that can pull a profit with as few errors (bad trades) as possible even with market motion. Some of these are successful, some aren't. My lowest so far in a simulation has been an error rate of 2.8% over 30 days with a gain over buy-hold of ~40%.

You can find Zenbot over at https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot

After installing that and learning a bit about it, just download these strategies and test them out.

## Use at your own risk!

I say this a lot on r/zenbot, run sims, run sims, run sims. There are a lot of options and variables to take into account for a "winning strategy". Even the exchange and trading pair is a variable. Be careful, you could lose without proper testing.

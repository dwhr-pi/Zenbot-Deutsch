# zenbot_strategies

These are my custom Zenbot strategies, from Zenbot Strategies that didn't work. I noticed some flaws in much of the strategies in Zenbot.

You can find Zenbot over at https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot

## Use at your own risk!

I say this a lot on r/zenbot, run sims, run sims, run sims. There are a lot of options and variables to take into account for a "winning strategy". Even the exchange and trading pair is a variable. Be careful, you could lose without proper testing.

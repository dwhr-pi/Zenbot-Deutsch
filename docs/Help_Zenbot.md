# Help Zenbot
## Introduction

 

If you like Zenbot and would like to help in its development, apart from [direct donation](Donate.md) there are many other things you can do, even if you are not a programmer.

## Work on the documentation 

Help us to build, correct and extend this documentation. Correct mistakes, extend or correct pages that are unclear, create new pages if a topic is missing, etc. Contributing to the Zenbot wiki is easy, at [WikiPages](WikiPages.md) you can find the general guidelines and the help needed to get you started. To edit the wiki, you will need a wiki account with \"Editor\" permissions (the wiki is write-protected to avoid spamming). You can ask for an account [on the forum]() or on the [IRC channel](). Please note that the IRC channel may not be as responsive as the forum. [The official Zenbot forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/zenbot/) should be the premier place to ask questions and start discussions, As it will help preserve the experience and knowledge of the community.

A couple of areas that would welcome your work:

-   The [:Category:Command Reference](:Category_Command_Reference.md) page lists and documents all of the Zenbot [commands](command.md). Most of them contain little to no information at all. Please refer to [WikiPages](WikiPages.md) for good examples of what command documentation pages should look like.
-   The [Tutorials](Tutorials.md) section needs examples on how to use the workbenches. If you developed something cool with Zenbot, why not document how you did it for posterity?
-   There are open tickets on the Zenbot [bug tracker](Tracker.md) tagged [\"documentation\"]() that could use some love.

## Share your Zenbot knowledge 

The user community around Zenbot is still small, but already includes several advanced users who do a very important job in showing to newcomers how to use the software. If you begin to feel comfortable with Zenbot, your knowledge could be very valuable to others, and you might contribute with important assets, like:

-   Showing the work you do with Zenbot on the <!--[Users Showcase forum]()-->. You can post screenshots, and, even better, attach the Zenbot files so other people can examine it and understand how you did it.
-   Recording <!--[videos]()--> showing how you did something interesting in Zenbot. These videos usually do a great job in showing new features.
-   Write <!--[tutorials]()--> describing or teaching something interesting. You can write tutorials on your own blog, directly on our wiki, or even on the forum.
-   Post on the <!--[Mastodon]()--> open source social network (and [follow Zenbot]<!--(https://fosstodon.org/@Zenbot)--> there) or on the [Zenbot's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1407097289750298/) community.
-   Look into the latest Zenbot posts on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/zenbot/), 


[Zenbot at StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&q=Zenbot), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Zenbot)\... Try to answer them and participate in the discussions sharing your experience and information.
-   Be present at the Zenbot IRC channel or [other chat groups]()

## Translate Zenbot 

Translate Zenbot to your own language. All text strings of the Zenbot interface can be easily translated to other languages. All we need is someone who knows that other languages and is willing to help! All the translations are done online on [Crowdin]().

For details on translation, see [Localisation](Localisation.md).

## Translate the documentation 

Translating is easy, the Zenbot wiki supports a translation plugin which allows you to translate the base English page to other languages.

For details on translation, see [Localisation\#Translating the wiki](Localisation#Translating_the_wiki.md).

Please be sure you are familiar with the basics of wiki markup; see [Help:Editing](Help_Editing.md) for a reference.

Then head to [WikiPages](WikiPages.md) to familiarize yourself with the style used in this wiki, particularly when it comes to templates.

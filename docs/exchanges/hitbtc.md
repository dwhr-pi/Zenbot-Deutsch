## Fehlermeldugen 

__Insufficient funds to place an order__ - Your first order does not exceed the minimum set by the HitBTC exchange. It is necessary to increase the amount of the first or extra order. $11 is usually enough. 

__Error placing Extra order Error create newBuyOrder (Order rejected). orderExceedsLimit__ - The crypto trading bot was unable to place an extra order due to lack of funds.

__Error create newBuyOrder (Order rejected). orderExceedsLimit__ - Not enough funds to start a deal.

__Error placing Extra order Error create newBuyOrder (InvalidRequest). Connection error__ - Connection error, no need to worry, just restart the bot after a few minutes.

__Error create TakeProfit order (Order rejected). orderExceedsLimit__ - It means that the bot can’t sell the amount of coins that were originally bought. This could happen if the fee was partially paid with certain coins. In your future transactions, allow the cryptocurrency bot to buy coins to pay fees. To fix this, you need to buy the minimum amount of traded coins, unfreeze the bot and reset Take Profit.

__cURL error 7: Failed to connect__ - Failed to connect to the cryptocurrency exchange. Try again in a couple minutes.

__Error canceling Extra order Can’t cancel order (Reject Exception)__ - Failed to cancel the order.
